The internal topographic representation is via an unstructured triangular mesh (herein 'the mesh'). An example of what this looks like is below.

Internally, the mesh is held in a CGAL structure that provides various ease-of-use structures. The relevant files are in ```mesh/```. 

# Iteration
Because the triangle iterators provided by CGAL have a non-deterministic order, as well as being incompatible with OpenMP, the way to access the i-th triangle is via
```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for
    for (size_t i = 0; i < domain->size_faces(); i++)
    {
        auto elem = domain->face(i);
     ...
    }
```

# Internal data structure
The mesh is represented as a vector of (x,y,z) points, connected via edges which are indexes into the vertex array. Thus, two vectors are held in memory as (pseudo code)
```python
vertexes = [ 
  [x1,y1,z1],
  [x2,y2,z2],
  [x3,y3,z3]
]

triangles = [
  [1,2,3]
]
```

Above, this represents a single triangle.

# Input
The input mesh is produced using the [mesher](https://github.com/Chrismarsh/mesher) tool. Please see the mesher documentation for more details.
