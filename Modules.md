# Overview
Modules are the short-hand for a process representation. A principal design goal of a module is that it may depend either upon some set of variables produced by either other modules or on input forcing data. Modules define a set of variables which it provides globally to other modules. A module may not ever write any other variable global variable which it does declare. It should also not overwrite the variables of another module.

There are two types of modules: 
+ Forcing data interpolant
+ Standard module

Forcing data interpolants (```modules/interp_met```) depend upon point-scale input forcing data variables and interpolate these data onto every domain element. Standard modules (```modules/*```) depend only upon the output of the ```interp_met``` modules as well as other module outputs.

All modules may either be data parallel or domain parallel. Data parallel modules are point-scale models that are applied to every triangle. Domain parallel modules are modules that require knowledge of surrounding mesh points.

# Implementation Details
Modules inherent from ```module_base.hpp``` and implement a standard interface. In the most simple case, a module must have a constructor which defines all variable dependencies and a run function. 

## Data parallel
Data parallel modules implement a ```run``` function that takes as input a single mesh element to operate upon. These modules do not need to implement any special-sauce to be parallel. The main model loop automatically schedules modules to execute in parallel. Domain parallel modules may access the ```elem``` variable directly to get access to the triangle element.

The constructor is used to set a module to be the correct parallel type.

``` cpp
class data_parallel_example : public module_base
{
public:
    data_parallel_example(config_file cfg);
    ~data_parallel_example();
    void run(mesh_elem& face, boost::shared_ptr<global> global_param);
}; 

data_parallel_example::data_parallel_example(config_file cfg)
        :module_base(parallel::data)
{
...
}
```

## Domain parallel
Domain parallel modules implement a run function that takes the entire mesh domain. The module must iterate over the faces of the domain to gain access to each element. This may be done in parallel but must be explicitly done by the module.
```cpp
class domain_parallel_example : public module_base
{
public:
    domain_parallel_example(config_file cfg);
    ~domain_parallel_example();
    void run(mesh domain, boost::shared_ptr<global> global_param);
}; 

domain_parallel_example::domain_parallel_example(config_file cfg)
        :module_base(parallel::domain)
{
...
}

void run(mesh domain, boost::shared_ptr<global> global_param)
{
 #pragma omp parallel for
    for (size_t i = 0; i < domain->size_faces(); i++)
    {
        auto face = domain->face(i);
       /** do stuff with face **/
    }
}
```

## init()
In all cases a module may implement the ```init``` function.
```cpp
void example_module::init(mesh domain, boost::shared_ptr<global> global_param)
```
Regardless of if the module is data or domain parallel, this function receives the entire mesh. ```init``` is called exactly once, after all other model setup has occurred, but prior to the main model execution loop. It is responsible for any initialization required by the model. An example of a complicated ```init``` is found in [Liston_wind](https://github.com/Chrismarsh/CHM/blob/master/src/modules/interp_met/Liston_wind.cpp) where the ```init``` function is used to pre-compute the wind curvature function.

In some cases, a module may be able to work in either a domain parallel or a data parallel mode with little modification. To avoid duplicating code, a module may provide two `run` methods, one for each. Then, in the `init` function, it can change the type of parallelism that is declared. This is the only place where this change can be safely done. To do so, both run interfaces are exposed:
```
    virtual void run(mesh domain);
    virtual void run(mesh_elem &face);
```
and then in `init`, the module can query `global` as if CHM is in point-mode. If not, it can safely switch to domain parallel. E.g.:
```
    if(!global_param->is_point_mode())
        _parallel_type =  parallel::domain;
```

## Variables

### Dependencies
In the constructor, a module declares itself to ```provides``` a set of variables and optionally ```depends``` upon other variables. Lastly, it may ```optionally``` depend upon a variable. If the the variable is not present, module dependency checks will still succeed, but the module *must* check prior to access to avoid a segfault. If a

```cpp
# from another modules
depends("ilwr");

#optionally depend on another modules output
optional("snow_albedo");

#provide for another module.
provides("dQ");
```

### Variable access
Modules read from a variable stored on the mesh element via
```cpp
auto albedo = elem->face_data("snow_albedo");
```
Modules may *only* write to variables they provide via
```cpp
elem->set_face_data("dQ", 100.0);
```

If ```optional``` has been used, a module can test for existance via
```cppp
 if(has_optional("snow_albedo"))
    {
       #do stuff
    }
    else
    {
       #default behaviour?
    }
```

## Data storage
Frequently, the module must maintain a set of data that is separate from the variables that are exposed to other modules with the ```set_face_data``` function. These data can be stored in two ways: a) as a member variable in the module class; b) in a per-triangle data store. If the data is stored as a member variable, this is global to every call of the module and shared across the entire mesh. Remember, there is only 1 instance of a module class. To achieve per-triangle data storage, a module should create a sub-class that inherants from ```face_info```

```cpp
class test : public module_base
{
 struct data : public face_info
    {
       double my_data;
    }
};
```

This sub-class then should be initialized on each element using ```make_module_data```. As the class' member variable ```ID``` is passed to the call to create and access the data, other modules' data is technically available for access. *Don't do this*.

```cpp
auto d = face->make_module_data<test::data>(ID);  #returns the instance just created
d->my_data = 5;

#access later
auto d = face->get_module_data<test::data>(ID); 
```

## interp_met modules
Meterological interpolation functions are slightly different than the above. They should all declare an interpolant in their per-face data store. This must be on a per-element basis to ensure parallelism is possible. If this is not done, large wait-locks must be used to prevent the internal consistency of the linear systems. The other benefit of this design is the interpolant is on a per-module basis, allowing each module to use a different interpolant.

```cpp
    struct data : public face_info
    {
        interpolation interp;
    };
```
The ```interpolation``` object is a combo functor and factory. Its goal is to abstract the creation of different types of spatial interpolators. Currently Inverse-Distance-Weighting (IDW) and Thin Plate Spline with Tension (TPSwT) are implemented (although only TPSwT is usable). The interpolation method is choosable via the ```interp_alg``` enum. This is passed to the constructor
```cpp
interpolation::init(interp_alg ia, size_t size)
```
For performance reasons, it is best to initialize the interpolator prior to the module running. The size parameter should be used to denote the number of locations to be used in the interpolation. 

The interpolation is performed by calling operator () on the interpolation instance
```cpp
operator()(std::vector< boost::tuple<double,double,double> >& sample_points, boost::tuple<double,double,double>& query_point)
```
where ```sample_points``` is a vector of (x,y,value) location tuples of each input data. ```query_point``` is then the (x,y,z) location we wish to interpolate. Frequently values cannot be interpolate directly and requires lowering to a common reference level. An example of what this looks like for constant temperature lapse rate is shown.

```cpp
    double lapse_rate = 0.0065;
    //lower all the station values to sea level prior to the interpolation
    std::vector< boost::tuple<double, double, double> > lowered_values;
    for (auto& s : global_param->stations)
    {
        if( is_nan(s->get("t")))
            continue;
        double v = s->get("t") - lapse_rate * (0.0 - s->z());
        lowered_values.push_back( boost::make_tuple(s->x(), s->y(), v ) );
    }

    auto query = boost::make_tuple(elem->get_x(), elem->get_y(), elem->get_z());
    double value = elem->get_module_data<data>(ID)->interp(lowered_values, query);

    //raise value back up to the face's elevation from sea level
    value =  value + lapse_rate * (0.0 - elem->get_z());
```

If the interpolant requires knowledge of the number of stations (e.g., TPSwT), and less stations are input (e.g., a NaN value is present -- see [timeseries](Timeseries), the the interpolant will on-the-fly reinitialize itself with the new size.

#Inter-module dependencies
Intermodule dependencies, and thus the order to run modules, is resolved during to run time. The order of module execution is not dependent upon the order listed in the configuration file (see [Configuration](Configuration)). The interpolation modules always come prior to the process modules. 

Inter-module variable dependencies is determined via the ```provides``` and ```depends``` declarations in the constructor. A module's dependencies are *every* other module that provides that output. This connectivity is represented internally with a graph. Thus, the linear sequential execution of the modules is determined via a topological sort. 

If [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) is installed, ```modules.pdf``` is generated which contains the graph of the inter-module dependencies. 
![](https://github.com/Chrismarsh/CHM/blob/master/modules_readme.png)

Once the linear order is determined, the modules are chunked into execution groups depending on their ```parallel::``` flag. For example, consider the following set of modules, sorted via the topological sort:
```
mod_A (parallel::data)
mod_B (parallel::data)
mod_C (parallel::data)
mod_D (parallel::domain)
mod_E (parallel::data)
```
These are then chunked into 3 sub groups:
```
mod_A (parallel::data)
mod_B (parallel::data)
mod_C (parallel::data)
```
```
mod_D (parallel::domain)
```
```
mod_E (parallel::data)
```

In the first data parallel subgroup, ```mod_A```, ```mod_B```, ```mod_C``` are executed sequentially on each triangle, but each triangle is done in parallel. Then subgroup 2 is run over the entire domain. Then subgroup 3 runs in parallel. 

This purpose of this chunking is to attempt to schedule as many modules as possible, to avoid the increase in overhead of running M modules over N mesh points.


# Registration with module factory
Once the module has been written, it needs to be registered with the module factory. 

1. Add the modules .hpp file as an include to ```module_factory.hpp```
2. Add to the if-chain in ```module_factory.cpp``` to create a module based off a string parameter.

```cpp
else if (ID == "Gray_inf")
        mod = new Gray_inf(config);
```
