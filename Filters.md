Filters are a mechanism whereby the input forcing data can be modified in some way prior to the model run. For example, this could be use to apply a gauge undercatch to precip. Filters modify the data of a station _in situ_.

Note! Filters run in the order defined in the configuration file.

# Implementation

Filters inherent from the base ```filter_base``` class. 

It must impliment the ```process``` function which recives as input a station.
```cpp
void process(boost::shared_ptr<station> station);
```

# process
The timeseries data have a ```next()``` iterator so can be traversed in a do...while loop.

An example for wind undercatch is as follows:
```cpp
    std::string var = cfg.get<std::string>("variable");
    do{
        double data = station->now().get(var);
        double u = station->now().get("u");
        data = data * (1.010 * exp(-0.09*u));
        station->now().set(var,data);
    }while(station->next());
```
